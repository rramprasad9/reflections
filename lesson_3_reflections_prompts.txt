When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I wanted to share and collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To avoid unexpected changes getting from into the local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - Clone in GitHub.
    Clone - From GitHub to local system.
    Branch - Separate work locally or on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We use it to understand what changes are in GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It will become easy to collaborate with GitHub.
    Manual collaboration on big projects is almost impossible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Team collaboration is possible when each team memer uses separate branch for each
    feature/bug fix.
